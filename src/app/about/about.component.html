    <h3>For The Love Of Indian Sports</h3>
    <p>
        This app is born out of my ever growing frustration with Indian Main Stream media and their ignorence towards
        Olympics sports. Here, you can track qualified Indian athletes for Tokyo, Find official qualification pathway,
        find
        upcoming Olympic qualification events. The app currently only focuses on sports in which our
        Indian athletes have a genuine chance of qualifying for Tokyo 2020, It's based on my own intuition, I hope I get
        it wrong(Honestly, I'd love that).

        Also, one of the things which is hot on twitter these days is of all Bollywood Celebs jumping on the bandwagon,
        tweeting about glory to India and Indian athletes.
        They end up making a shitty sports biopics(Smash it like Sindhu may be next).
        That's why Shows I love section is there, you'll find some of the best sports shows and movies which I've ever
        come across while watching shows.I'll update the list frequently when I come across more.
        The shows are in no particular order, but every damn thing in that list has a great rewatch value attached. It's
        definitely worth your time.
